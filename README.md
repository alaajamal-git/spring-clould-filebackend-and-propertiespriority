# spring-clould-filebackend-and-propertiespriority

I this project we set up to a file system repository rather than GIT by using two properties on Config-Server : "spring.profiles.active" for repository type and "spring.cloud.config.server.native.search-locations" for the location of our properties files. To activate priority we should set the property 'spring.cloud.config.name' in bootstrap file to the name of our microservice in our case users-ws. In the repo dir, we created two property files: 'application.properties' this file is shared for all microservices and 'users-ws.properties' was specified for users microservice. That means users microservice would use the two properties files but if the same property appeares in the two files then the 'users-ws.properties' priority has the higher priority.
